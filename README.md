# ChessKingHill

This is the project I have decided to work on for my AI class.
It will be a chess game for the the alternative version of chess: King of the Hill.
What this application can do:
- allow 1 person to play
- the player will play against an AI bot

That's about it for now.
I will add a proper description once I finish implementing all of the features I want to add.
I will probably add a help (as in, how to play), but maybe it won't be necessary considering how self intuitive a chess game is.
